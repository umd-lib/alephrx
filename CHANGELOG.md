## 1.0.4

- Fixed issue with a direct call to ALEPHemail.cgi resulting in
  an empty report being added to the database. (LIBILS-64)

## 1.0.3

- Fixed issue with "special characters" (dashes, Microsoft Word
  "smart quotes", and bullets) being expanded every time a DSS
  response was made. (LIBILS-62)

## 1.0.2

  Configuration" button on "Confirm AlephRx Email Notifications"
  page to "Submit". (LIBILS-61)

- Updated the page titles, headings, and navigational labels to be more
  consistent and informative.
